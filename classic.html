  <div align="center">
  <img src="../images/Toubkal.jpg">
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p align="center"><font size="5">-Imlil is a village located high up in the Atlas Mountains, at 1,800 meters above sea level.you will find a nice base to summit Mount Toubkal as well as the hub of mountain activity before you star your trek.Toubkal is the highest mountain in the country and this is where many hikers will be heading.</font></p>
  <p><font size="5">-You can take a tour through of the other nearby villages of Ikkiss and Asni.In the winter you'll gget to see thick snow and in the summer you can hike it in 2 or 3 days and fall in love with the local forest as you trek to reach the top.Keep in mind this is a difficult mounain to climb,and you will need special gear and be fit enough to endure the climb.You should never hike this path alone,always hire a guide as the weather and conditions are constantly changing.</font></p>

  <br>
  <p align="center"><font size="6"><u>JBEL SAGHRO</u></font></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <div align="center">
  <img src="../images/jbel.jpg">
  </div>
  <p align="center"><font size="5">-Located in the Atlas Mountains, you will find Jbel Saghro which offers picturesque landscapes.While the temperatures here are not as harsh as in other areas,you will still have a difficult journey that will last about a week.Located at 2,712meters,you can get altitude sickness,so if you are lucky to make the whole climb,be sure to look at the caves in the area as well as cave paintings located inside of them.you will pass by barerock and villages like N'kob and Tazzarine.This area is very dry despite being close to the Atlantic Ocean.</font></p>
  <p><font size="5">-You will want to be prepared with special gear and stay hydrated by using a <font color="FF0000"><b>survival straw</b></font>when you drink clean water .Having a survival straw can mean the difference between healthy drinking water, and contaminated,leading to illness.Hiking is very hard when you need to seek medical attention off of the trail.It's best to be prepared to filter your own water.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="6"><u>M'GOUN MASSIF</u></font></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <div align="center">
  <img src="../images/mgoun.jpg">
  </div>
  <p align="center"><font size="5">-Located in the central area of the Atlas Mountains,you can find this to be a less difficult journey than the first two we have mentioned.You can hen enjoy the scenery around you which includes wild flowers,rivers and valleys.</font></p>
  <p><font size="5">-If you can spend a week here,it is really worth it,though it only takes about 4 or 5 days to trek through this area.It is also worth nothing that this is another dry area that can have snow-capped mountains in the winter,which melts into the valleys and streams nearby.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="6"><u>SIRWA</u></font></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <div align="center">
  <img src="../images/sirwa.jpg">
  </div>
  <p align="center"><font size="5">-Located in the Anti-Atlas region ,you can find sirwa in the southern part of the country.With many peaks,this once volcanic mountain connects the Anti-Atlas region with he High Atlas region.You can take one of two trails to get up;the hike only takes 2 days,and you can take an extra day or two to go through Berber valleys,fields,and visit the city of Taliouine for local flavor.</font></p>
  <p><font size="5">-Be warned that the final leg of this trip can be risky,but overall this is a moderate hike.At over3,300 meters high,you will see the volcanic mountain in all of its glory.This is a hike that is not to be missed due to its natural environment and awe inspiring beauty.</font></p>
  <p><font size="5">-Don't forget to stop in a village and taste some of the local food,especially dishes and tea using saffron which grows prominently in this region.Besides the scenery,you can find some great meals that have been around for generations</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="6"><u>RIF MOUNTAINS</u></font></p>

  <div align="center">
  <img src="../images/rif.jpg">
  </div>
  <p align="center"><font size="5">-Away from the Atlas mountain region,in northern Morocco,you will find the Rif Mountains.This mountain range is lesser known to visitors but is well known to visitors but is well known among locals who love to spend time here.Not only can you hike this range for several days but you can also take day trips to various cities and explore what they have to offer.</font></p>
  <p><font size="5">-Hiking from <font color="FF0000">Chefchaouen</font> to the Ras El-Mass River,is a day trip you can complete without getting overtired.You get to choose how long you want to explore this mountain range,due to the diversity and abundance of trails!Hoever,if you want a more difficult route,you can hike Jebel al-Kalaa,which takes you to a scenic view of the town.Many overnight trips are taken when you go to explore Talassemtane National Park,where you can take your time and see everything from the mountains and trees to the valleys and rivers.</font></p>
